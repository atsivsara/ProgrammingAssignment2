## So here there are two functions a) makeCacheMatrix andb)cacheSolve
## These functions are used to calculate the inverse of a Matrix by caching the inverse
## which is a better method than computing the result again and again 

## mackeCacheMatrix function - creates a special matrix that cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


##cache Solve function - calculates the inverse of the matric returned 
## by the prrevious function 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
